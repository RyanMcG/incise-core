  function at its core is just a function which takes two arguments:

                   title

  This macro makes it just a little bit easier to define such functions by
  taking care of some boiler plate stuff like using the robert.hooke with-scope
  macro and binind the functions arguments to *site-options* and *parse* so
  partials can easily access them."
