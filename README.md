# incise-core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMcG/incise-core.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMcG/incise-core)
An extensible static site generator written in Clojure.

This is the core component of incise.
If you want the batteries included version see [incise][].

Since incise-core uses edn, Clojure 1.4+ is required.

## Running tests

```bash
lein test-and-spec
```
