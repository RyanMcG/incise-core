# incise-core
An extensible static site generator written in Clojure.

This is the core component of incise.
If you want the batteries included version see [incise][].

## Running specs

Unfortunately the speclj leiningen plugin does not work well with clj-v8 because
it requires custom JVM options (this seems to be a bug with speclj). However,
you can still run the tests using `lein run`:

```bash
lein run -m specj.main
# The vigilant runner works too
lein run -m specj.main -a
```

## What's next?
